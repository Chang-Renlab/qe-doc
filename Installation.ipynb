      "\n",
      "The use of the qe-util/nipy packages require some preparations to be made.\n",
      "You need to install and configure several packages. The operation is fairly \n",

      "Pre-requisites\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "\n",
      "To run the programs you need a fairly recent linux system. \n",
      "Any decent and modern linux distribution will do, but the code was developed and\n",
      "tested on Ubuntu 13.10/64.\n",
      "\n",
      "You will need the current python install with virtualenv system installed.\n",

      "\n",
      "This will create the nipy directory which is a place where all software will be \n",

      "not too. If you have a recent and complete distribution and you know what you \n",
      "are doing  you can try to use a --site-packages option to virtualenv and skip \n",

      "\n",
      "Essentially you need to figure out how to transport files from your \n",
      "workstation to the computing machine and how to run jobs there. \n",
      "One very comfortable way of doing this is mounting the remote directory \n",
      "locally using sshfs and setting up the key-authentication execution over ssh\n",
